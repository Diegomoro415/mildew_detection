## Brief Introduction

Cherry Leaf Mildew Detection project, uses the power of machine learning to
transform the way we inspect cherry trees. Our goal is to visually
differentiate healthy cherry leaves from those affected by powdery mildew
and predict the health of cherry leaves. This project is driven by the
critical needs of the cherry plantation industry to ensure the supply of
high-quality cherries to the market efficiently and cost-effectively.

## Dataset Content

- The dataset is sourced from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). We then
created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied
in a real project in the workplace.
- The dataset contains +4 thousand images taken from the client's crop fields.
The images show healthy cherry leaves and cherry leaves that have powdery
mildew, a fungal disease that affects many plant species. The cherry
plantation crop is one of the finest products in their portfolio, and
the company is concerned about supplying the market with a compromised
quality product.

## Business Requeriment

The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where
their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently,
the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery
mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few
samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy
or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a
specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound
is 1 minute.  The company has thousands of cherry trees, located on multiple
farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable
due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects
instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew.
A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests,
and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to
replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of
cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

1. The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a
healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
2. The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or
contains powdery mildew.
